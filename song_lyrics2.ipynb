Hearing voices I know well, And long for.  Cold and boozy, Our holiday in the Alps. Sitting in the lobby, Mostly smoking. Choking on the woozy afternoon.  I\\'m reeling in the music And I\\'ve only had a few. And I\\'m afraid By the way we grow old, My darling.  Abrupt, too moody, You making our party list. I remember sulking On the sofa. For most of the winter We were strangers.  Just one more To ease the ache, Before the night takes me. When you stay asleep On your side of the bed, Don\\'t look at me, Don\\'t look at you...  I\\'m reeling in the music And I\\'ve only had a few. And I\\'m afraid By the way we grow old,     ',\n",

The more I think about sex, the better it gets.   Here we have a purpose in life:   Good for the blood circulation,   Good for releasing the tension,   The root of our reincarnations.
